	2 Budget and Performance</h1>
<p>The ISE&rsquo;s Annual Planning Cycle is shown below in Figure 2, focuses on implementing the 16 priority objectives of the <a href="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/2012infosharingstrategy.pdf">National Strategy</a>. Driving the cycle are the implementation plans for the National Strategy&rsquo;s priority objectives and the annual NSS and OMB Programmatic Guidance,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> which guides federal agencies&rsquo; prioritization of ISE investments in their budget formulation process. The challenging fiscal environment necessitates the need for thoughtful choices that balance the need to meet current agency mission requirements with interoperable, standards-based solutions.</p>

<h2>
	2.1 Annual Budget Planning Cycle</h2>
<p>To more specifically implement White House priorities, PM-ISE publishes annual capability-focused ISE Implementation Guidance,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> which is developed by PM-ISE in collaboration with federal ISE agencies via the ISA IPC and provides ISE agencies objective, system-wide performance goals for the following year as required by IRTPA &sect;1016(h).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> The ISE Implementation Guidance directly reflects the planning year actions associated with each the 16 priority objectives in the National Strategy. To measure agency performance against these goals, and in compliance with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/mgmt-gpra/index-gpra">Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRA) of 2010</a><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> and OMB guidelines, the office of the PM-ISE conducts <a href="http://ise.gov/ise-performance-management">ISE performance</a> assessments each year in the form of questionnaires sent to ISE agencies. Agency responses inform the <a href="http://ise.gov/ise-performance-management">ISE&rsquo;s Performance Framework</a> and help PM-ISE measure progress toward realizing the National Strategy; the maturity of ISE initiatives; identifying gaps, challenges and opportunities to be addressed in the following year&rsquo;s planning; and comprise the basis for the annual ISE Report to the Congress.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Responses to the annual performance assessment also help agencies examine their own programs that support the ISE, which can be helpful when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Communicating with OMB examiners;</li>
	<li>
		Ensuring that efforts to implement the National Strategy&rsquo;s priority objectives are aligned with performance measures and department or agency strategic goals; and,</li>
	<li>
		Making program and budget decisions in subsequent years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ISE Annual Planning Cycle demonstrates how the National Strategy, priorities, and implementation plans are linked in order to track, monitor, and provide and account for progress as transparently as possible.</p>

				<h4>Opportunity in a Challenging Fiscal Environment</h4>
				<p>Resource constraints, especially among state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) law enforcement agencies, have necessitated the transformation of information sharing business models. Significant cost savings could be realized through consolidation, regionalization, and reuse of trusted open standards based IT platforms. One example is PM-ISE sponsorship of a <a href="http://www.ise.gov/annual-report/section3.html#section-6b">critical event deconfliction initiative</a> to identify nationwide deconfliction standards and solutions; connect deconfliction systems; and develop a nationwide deconfliction strategy.</p>
</div>
	<h2>
		2.2 The ISE Performance Framework</h2>
	<p>The ISE Performance Framework, through the application of the ISE Annual Planning Cycle&rsquo;s tools, allows PM-ISE and ISE agencies to apply maturity-defined performance measures to monitor the performance of responsible information sharing initiatives. The framework aids PMâ€‘ISE and ISE agencies as they:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Identify initiatives or capabilities that will help achieve strategic ISE goals</li>
		<li>
			Align initiatives with strategic objectives</li>
		<li>
			Identify gaps in these initiatives</li>
		<li>
			Fill the gaps and implement ISE best practices</li>
		<li>
			Develop measures to track information sharing progress and its impacts</li>
		<li>
			Implement a roadmap with milestones to track progress and impact</li>
	</ul>
	<p>At the core of the ISE Performance Framework are the five goals of the National Strategy. PM-ISE aligns all responsible information sharing initiatives in the ISE with those goals and then identifies the technologies, processes, and community capabilities required to mature those initiatives to point where they achieve the goals as shown below in Figure 3.</p>
	<p><strong>The ISE Performance Framework</strong><br/><img alt="The ISE Performance Framework" src="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/mpfigure3.png"/></p>
	<p>PM-ISE and mission partners continue to evolve performance measurement, including implementing outcome-based measures to help assess the national security results achieved through key initiatives. PM-ISE and ISE agencies have developed a series of performance scenarios to help agencies think about how information sharing and safeguarding efforts impact mission outcomes, and to help turn generic maturity definitions into measures that are specific to an ISE initiative. The scenarios take strategic information sharing requirements (e.g., get the right information to the right people at the right time) and apply them to real mission situations (e.g., a maritime security analyst identifies a specific threat in an eastern port). The scenarios illustrate that as responsible information sharing capabilities mature, ISE partners can see an improvement in their ability to accomplish their mission. The <a href="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/PM-ISE_Performance_Scenario_Guide.pdf">Performance Scenario Guide</a> helps partner agencies develop performance case scenarios and plan and execute information sharing initiatives that are grounded in performance metrics.</p>
	<p>This Management Plan provides common business processes and tools to enable stakeholder collaboration while executing the National Strategy, and as such will be integrated into future performance assessments and scenarios. See Appendix A for examples of how an agency can assess their maturity in using the tools described in this Management Plan.</p>
	<h4>
		Benefits of Participation in the Performance Process</h4>
	<p>The following example illustrates the benefits of participating in the process to develop annual guidance for the ISE; implementing that guidance within a defined governance structure; and measuring the performance of implementation to achieve information sharing capabilities.</p>
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
					<h4>Requiring and Enabling the Sharing of Information and Protecting Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties</h4>
					<p>Both federal and non-federal partners are required to develop and implement written privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties (P/CR/CL) policies consistent with the ISE Privacy Guidelines. All of the abovementioned ISE management tools were used to accelerate the completion of ISE P/CR/CL protection policies by federal partners, resulting in the completion of policies by 93% of federal ISE mission partners. The 2013 ISE Performance Assessment measured the effectiveness of common P/CR/CL protections throughout ISE federal partners and found:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							ISE mission partners continue to develop and implement P/CR/CL protection policies as required by the ISE Privacy Guidelines to ensure that the information privacy and other legal rights of Americans are protected while exchanging data via the information sharing environment.</li>
						<li>
							Additional work is needed to increase the use of internal agency compliance, oversight, and accountability mechanisms for consistency in the application of P/CR/CL protections.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Beginning in 2010, DHS included special condition language in homeland security grants to state and local governments requiring that fusion centers complete ISE P/CR/CL protection policies within six months of receiving a grant award. The addition of this grant condition enabled all operational designated state and major urban area fusion centers to have completed ISE P/CR/CL protection policies as of April 2011.</p>
