      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>What is the ISE?</h3>
      <p>Our national security depends on our ability to responsibly share the right information, with the right people, at the right time.</p>
<div style="margin-left:.7in;">
	<p>As President, I have no greater responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of the United States and the American people. Meeting this responsibility requires the closest possible cooperation among our intelligence, military, diplomatic, homeland security, law enforcement, and public health communities, as well as with our partners at the State and local level and in the private sector. This cooperation, in turn, demands the timely and effective sharing of intelligence and information about threats to our Nation with those who need it, from the President to the police officer on the street.</p>
	<p>President Barack Obama</p>
	<p>National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding,<br />
		December 2012</p>
</div>
<p>The idea of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) originated in the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/">9/11 Commission Report</a> and was mandated in &sect;1016 of the <a href="http://ise.gov/intelligence-reform-and-terrorism-prevention-act-2004-sec-1016-information-sharing">Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004</a> (IRTPA), as amended. The Act required the President to create a distributed and decentralized Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate the sharing of terrorism information in a manner consistent with national security and with applicable legal standards relating to privacy and civil liberties; and to designate a Program Manager responsible for planning for, overseeing the development of, and managing the ISE. The creation of the Office of the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) and the history of the ISE are detailed chronologically in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/informationsharingenvironment">PM-ISE&rsquo;s Facebook timeline</a>, with links available to relevant documents on <a href="http://www.ise.gov">ise.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Our nation continues to face significant challenges in analyzing and disseminating terrorism, WMD, and homeland security related information. Today, ISE partners are primarily focused on implementing the <a href="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/2012infosharingstrategy.pdf">National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding</a> (National Strategy), released in December 2012. We use its three principles: 1) information is a national asset, 2) information sharing and safeguarding requires shared risk management, and 3) information informs decision-making to guide our actions. The scope of the National Strategy is not limited to terrorism, homeland security, and weapons of mass destruction information, but has grown to encompass public safety and security mission areas. ISE solutions, processes, best practices, and tools are being reused and extended to help realize the vision of the IRTPA and the National Strategy.</p>

     
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
      <h4>ISE Principles in Action</h4>
<ul>
					<li>
						Lower program risk by highlighting proven processes and practices</li>
					<li>
						Increase program efficiency through of use of standards and reuse of innovations and capabilities</li>
					<li>
						Accelerate mission impact through strong alignment to National Strategy, and policy frameworks</li>
					<li>
						Sustain responsible collaboration among federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners through streamlined policies, reduced cultural barriers, and better integrated information systems</li>
				</ul>
    </div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this ISE Management Plan (Management Plan) is to provide common business processes and tools to enable collaboration among ISE stakeholders, which include federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and international partners. The goal is to unify efforts across government to advance the implementation of an environment that facilitates information sharing among partners, governs a complex set of stakeholders, advances standards and uniform policies and procedures, and enables interoperability across many networks and systems.</p>
<p>This Management Plan is a resource for ISE stakeholders at all levels of government and the private sector, from chief information officers (CIOs) to program managers. The tools serve to provide guidance, directives, processes, practices, tools, and illustrative use cases to help them:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Identify, prioritize, and resolve common problems;</li>
	<li>
		Assess and manage performance gaps;</li>
	<li>
		Harmonize policy;</li>
	<li>
		Convene communities of interest; and

	<li>
		Leverage and extend good ideas, best practices, and tools.</li>

	</li>
</ul>
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
      <h4>Why Engage? The Importance of Being an ISE Partner</h4>
<ul>
					<li>
						We are driven by common requirements for responsible information sharing</li>
					<li>
						We benefit from leveraging the work of partners whose missions align with our own</li>
					<li>
						The ISE connects and builds on existing systems</li>
					<li>
						ISE solutions support analysis, investigations, and operations at and across all security levels</li>
					<li>
						ISE solutions allow us to share information across mission domains and with multiple missions partners</li>
				</ul>

<p>A good resource to trace the evolution of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) in the context of information sharing reforms and goals for the future of responsible information sharing is <a href="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/Brief_History_of_the_ISE.pdf">A Brief History of the ISE</a>. A comprehensive list of guidance and directives can be accessed in our <a href="http://ise.gov/document_library">document library online</a>.</p>
<h3>How to Use this Document</h3>
<p>This document has four sections that provide details on the common processes and tools available to help you achieve your information sharing and safeguarding goals as a part of the ISE:</p>
<ol>
<li>Governance and policy</li>
<li>Budget and performance</li>
<li>Standards and interoperability</li>
<li>Communications</li>
</ol>
<p>Each section describes the specific steps to take and the resources available to help reach your responsible information sharing goals. Throughout the document, examples illustrate how partners are participating in and benefiting from the ISE&rsquo;s processes and tools. The <a href="http://ise.gov/building-blocks">ISE Building Blocks</a>, a knowledge management tool available on <a href="http://www.ise.gov/">ise.gov</a>, is an important companion to this management plan and is organized in a similar manner. It contains many important <a href="http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks/standards-and-interoperability#item=data-exchange-toolkit-tid-1101">toolkits</a>, lessons learned, successes, and best practices from our partners who are building their responsible information sharing programs.</p>
