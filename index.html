      <h5>What is the ISE?</h5>
      <p>Our national security depends on our ability to responsibly share the right information, with the right people, at the right time.</p>
<div style="margin-left:.7in;">
	<p>As President, I have no greater responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of the United States and the American people. Meeting this responsibility requires the closest possible cooperation among our intelligence, military, diplomatic, homeland security, law enforcement, and public health communities, as well as with our partners at the State and local level and in the private sector. This cooperation, in turn, demands the timely and effective sharing of intelligence and information about threats to our Nation with those who need it, from the President to the police officer on the street.</p>
	<p>National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding,<br />
		December 2012</p>
</div>
<p>The idea of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) originated in the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/">9/11 Commission Report</a> and was mandated in &sect;1016 of the <a href="http://ise.gov/intelligence-reform-and-terrorism-prevention-act-2004-sec-1016-information-sharing">Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004</a> (IRTPA), as amended. The Act required the President to create a distributed and decentralized Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate the sharing of terrorism information in a manner consistent with national security and with applicable legal standards relating to privacy and civil liberties; and to designate a Program Manager responsible for planning for, overseeing the development of, and managing the ISE. The creation of the Office of the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) and the history of the ISE are detailed chronologically in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/informationsharingenvironment">PM-ISE&rsquo;s Facebook timeline</a>, with links available to relevant documents on <a href="http://www.ise.gov">ise.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Our nation continues to face significant challenges in analyzing and disseminating terrorism, WMD, and homeland security related information. Today, ISE partners are primarily focused on implementing the <a href="http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/2012infosharingstrategy.pdf">National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding</a> (National Strategy), released in December 2012. We use its three principles: 1) information is a national asset, 2) information sharing and safeguarding requires shared risk management, and 3) information informs decision-making to guide our actions. The scope of the National Strategy is not limited to terrorism, homeland security, and weapons of mass destruction information, but has grown to encompass public safety and security mission areas. ISE solutions, processes, best practices, and tools are being reused and extended to help realize the vision of the IRTPA and the National Strategy.</p>
