      <h2>Governance and Policy</h2>
      <p>Governance and policy are used to drive the ISE toward coordinated and integrated resources and successfully implementing of the objectives of the National Strategy. Success depends upon all ISE partners participating in ISE governance processes and adopting or aligning policies that will ensure that we are working together in our implementation efforts, at all levels of government and in the private sector.</p>
<h3>
	1.1 Governance</h3>
<p>Governance facilitates sharing and safeguarding of information by providing structure for the development and implementation of policy. The two primary senior governance bodies for ISE Stakeholders are the Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee (ISA IPC) and the Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee (Steering Committee). These forums facilitate governance for responsible information sharing and safeguarding for all ISE partners at the level of the Executive Office of the President, in accordance with <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/ppd/ppd-1.pdf"><em>Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) &ndash; 1, Organization of the National Security Council System</em></a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/07/executive-order-structural-reforms-improve-security-classified-networks-">Executive Order 13587</a>.</p>
<h4>
	1.1.1 Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee</h4>
<p>The ISA IPC is co-chaired by the National Security Staff&rsquo;s Senior Director for Information Sharing Policy and the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment. While membership of the ISA IPC is restricted by law to federal departments and agencies, the ISA IPC scope includes all levels of government. ISA IPC subcommittees and working groups include federal, state, local, tribal and territorial mission owners as well as private sector partners. To ensure the candid and timely discussion of information sharing challenges that require policy action, the ISA IPC and its subsidiary groups are exempt from the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/100916">Federal Advisory Committee Act</a>.</p>
<p>The ISA IPC is guiding the implementation of each of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012sharingstrategy_1.pdf">National Strategy&rsquo;s 16 priority objectives</a>. Each priority objective is assigned a steward, or governance body responsible for directing, managing and monitoring implementation of the priority objective. The subcommittees of the ISA IPC are working to implement the objectives of the National Strategy, and in so doing develop goals that are approved and monitored by the ISA IPC. Representatives from ISE agencies, our ISE mission partners, chair these governance bodies and help to formulate implementation plans for their assigned objective(s). These plans are vetted with ISE stakeholders through the ISA IPC and include control milestones and performance measures that allow the ISA IPC to monitor National Strategy implementation. Subcommittees of the ISA IPC may formally charter working groups or create Tiger Teams to focus on narrower issues within a portfolio.</p>
<p>For more information on how to participate in National Strategy implementation, or for information on the current structure and activities of the ISA IPC, contact your agency&rsquo;s representative or PM-ISE&rsquo;s Management and Oversight Division at <a href="http://ise.gov/contact">ISE.gov/contact</a>.</p>
<h4>
	1.1.1 Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee</h4>
<p>The President established the Steering Committee in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/07/executive-order-structural-reforms-improve-security-classified-networks-">Executive Order 13587</a> to exercise overall responsibility and ensure senior-level accountability for interagency development and implementation of policies and standards regarding the sharing and safeguarding of classified information on computer networks.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee is co-chaired by senior representatives from NSS and the OMB E-Gov office. Membership includes representatives from Departments of State, Defense, Justice, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Information Security Oversight Office within the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
<p>The Classified Information Sharing and Safeguarding Office (CISSO), which is a component of the office of the PM-ISE, provide executive secretariat functions for the Steering Committee and collects data from agencies on the progress and performance of their safeguarding efforts. This data informs the Steering Committee&rsquo;s Annual Report to the President, which provides the White House an account of information sharing and safeguarding successes and challenges.</p>
<p>The current priorities of the Steering Committee are outlined in Priority Objective 5 of the National Strategy: <em>Implement removable media policies, processes and controls; provide timely audit capabilities of assets, vulnerabilities and threats; establish programs, processes and techniques to deter, detect and disrupt insider threats; and share the management of risks, to enhance unclassified and classified information safeguarding efforts</em>. If you would like more information, please contact the CISSO at <a href="http://ise.gov/contact">ISE.gov/contact</a>.</p>
<h4>
	1.1.2 Convening/Liaison</h4>
<p>Because the office of the PM-ISE is in a unique position to facilitate responsible information sharing across the whole of government, we play a neutral role when negotiating between mission interests of ISE stakeholders. The capability to convene stakeholders provides opportunities for constructive exchanges in a shared setting, as well as active listening among organizations with different missions, authorities, and resources. PM-ISE fills the role of honest broker to help non-federal players develop their requirements and inject them into national policy deliberations. When there are asymmetries between stakeholders, PMâ€‘ISE&rsquo;s ability to aggregate the concerns of less influential stakeholders is critical to the ultimate success of shared solutions. For example, PM-ISE&rsquo;s facilitation of interactions between and among individual fusion centers and their federal partners has increased the collective voice of the network of fusion centers. Additionally, a key role for PM-ISE and governance bodies is to identify technologies, capabilities, and services that can be shared across the ISE with the intent to leverage individual agency initiatives for the greater good.</p>
<p>ISE Stakeholders and priorities are often discussed in the <a href="https://cio.gov/">Federal CIO Council</a>, the <a href="https://www.cnss.gov/">Committee on National Security Systems</a>, the <a href="http://www.dsac.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Domestic Security Alliance Council</a>, and <a href="http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks/communications-and-partnerships#item=what-bodies-participate-in-information-sharing-and-safeguarding-tid-846">other interagency forums</a>. The office of the PM-ISE often works on behalf of agencies to clarify governance relationships, share ideas and deconflict tasks across these forums. For information on how to appropriately interface with these bodies, contact the PM-ISE Management and Oversight Division at <a href="mailto:DNI-PM-ISE-EXECSEC@dni.gov">DNI-PM-ISE-EXECSEC@dni.gov</a>.</p>

      <p>Fusion Centers and Private Sector Come Together on Cybersecurity</p>
<p>Agencies are undertaking new and emerging information sharing initiatives beyond traditional terrorism and homeland security missions. One example is ISE best practices and solutions supporting the cybersecurity mission and the priorities of the White House National Security Staff Cyber Directorate. PM-ISE, with the National Fusion Center Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, convened stakeholders from law enforcement, homeland security, emergency management, information technology, and the private sector to clarify <a href="http://ise.gov/blog/mike-sena/fusion-centers-and-private-sector-come-together-cybersecurity">requirements for sharing both tactical and strategic cybersecurity</a> information and to plan pilots for demonstrating these capabilities. For more details on this and other information sharing pilots, please contact the PM-ISE Mission Programs Division at <a href="http://ise.gov/contact">ISE.gov/contact</a>.</p>
