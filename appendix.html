      <p>This Management Plan provides common business processes and tools to enable stakeholder collaboration while implementing the National Strategy, and as such will be integrated into the future ISE performance scenarios. The table below shows the spectrum of maturity levels by capability area.</p>
      <p><strong>ISE Capability Areas and Maturity Spectrum</strong><br/>

      <p>Questions in the annual ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaires (PAQ) align to each maturity stage. We use industry and government best practices to guide the assessment efforts, including <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/77233.pdf">GAO’s framework for assessing and improving Enterprise Architecture</a>, and for <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04394g.pdf">assessing and improving the process maturity of Information Technology Investment Management</a>.</p>
      <p>The following list is a sampling of notional performance assessment questions that can be used by ISE Stakeholders to self-assess the level of maturity of applying the tools in this Management Plan.</p>
