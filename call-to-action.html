	5 Call to Action</h1>
<p>There are a number of ways your organization can partner with the office of the PM-ISE to support your organization and the Information Sharing Environment:</p>
<p><strong>Using the ISE Building Blocks</strong> &ndash; This tool shares the best practices of ISE mission partners. You can access the ISE Building Blocks at <a href="http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks">http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks</a> to learn more about ISE governance, budget and performance, acquisition, standards and interoperability, communications and partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Contributing to PM-ISE Communication Initiatives</strong> &ndash; PM-ISE&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement Team welcomes collaboration. ISE partners are encouraged to guest write blogs for <a href="http://www.ise.gov/">ise.gov</a>, team on social media initiatives, co-host events, and co-author positions papers.</p>
<p><strong>Participating in Information Sharing and Safeguarding Committees and Working Groups</strong> &ndash; There are a number of working groups tackling a range of challenges, from standards to interoperability including membership from all levels of government and private sector. <a href="http://www.ise.gov/contact?destination=thank-you-your-inquiry">Contact us</a> to find out more about opportunities to support these working groups.</p>
<p><strong>Contributing to the ISE Annual Report</strong> &ndash; The primary method for communicating ISE-related activities to the Congress is the ISE Annual Report to the Congress. We encourage you to review this year&rsquo;s Annual Report at <a href="http://www.ise.gov/annual-report">www.ise.gov/annual-report</a> and <a href="http://www.ise.gov/contact?destination=thank-you-your-inquiry">contact PM-ISE&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement Team</a> with ideas for content. The Annual Report is unclassified, but includes a classified annex that discusses classified programs and initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Making your Systems Interoperable</strong> &ndash; The ISE Interoperability Framework (I<sup>2</sup>F) provides the information you need to ensure your systems can effectively interoperate with others.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Detailees and Assignees</strong> &ndash; The office of the PM-ISE often has openings for rotational assignments, which are reimbursable positions and Intelligence Community Joint Duty eligible. PM-ISE also is looking for federal government employees to fill non-reimbursable assignee positions. Both types of positions support the Executive Offices of the President and lead a significant number of interagency and government-wide initiatives.</p>
